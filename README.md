I am a grammar school student whose purpose is discovering and implementing solutions for energy generation, transportation and storage while using these technologies to slow down climate change. 

Among the software technologies that I find enjoyable to work with are Arduino, Processing, and MkDocs. In the regional finals of the <a href="https://www.worldrobotolympiad.de/">World Robot Olympiad</a> held in 2023, my team and I placed third. Fueled by our passion for microelectronics and robotics, our aspiration is to win the regional finals,  therby attaining a top-ranking position on the national or rather international leaderboard.
